We value your kids.  That's why we have a program just for them.  They're having fun on the lower level.  You can take the stairs from the entrance hall.  Drop them off, but keep your cell phone turned on.  We'll text you if they need you.

## Volunteer Info

> Volunteering with Encounter kids can be fun and satisfying

We strive to have a program where kids have a safe and exciting place to play with their friends and learn amazing things from the Bible. To make a program like this possible **we rely on commited adults.**

If you feel God is nudging you to be more involved with *Encounter Kids* we would love to have you! While we always need teachers, we have a place for you, even if you aren't comfortable interacting directly with the kids. **Behind-the-scenes jobs are just as important as teaching.**

*We'd love to talk with you about getting involved, please contact [{{ site.data.authors.cliff.title }}, {{ site.data.authors.cliff.name }}](mailto:{{ site.data.authors.cliff.email }}).*
